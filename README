This code is for Memsim, a memory system simulator designed for speed and ease of use.

The simplicity of memsim makes it ideal for use in classrooms (where ramp-up time needs to be small and not all students may have a strong software background) and research studies focused on cache and memory systems.

The code provided with the first commit represents the artifact evaluation code from the MINT paper (MICRO 2024). 

We have validated the results with DRAMSim3, a highly accurate (albeit more complex) DRAM simulator, and obtained similar slowdowns. 

The directory structure is as follows:
-- src: contains the source code (about 16 files)
-- SCRIPTS: scripts for running the simulator and extracting data
-- RESULTS: storing results from simulations
-- TRACES: We provide traces for SPEC workloads (~400MB)

To generate the performance figure from the MINT paper, the following commands:

cd SCRIPTS
./runall.sh

The expeiments may take 2 hours.
Once finished, the scripts should gather data in rfmsb.txt
Then scripts should also generate rfmsb.pdf using the python scirpt rfmsb.py
